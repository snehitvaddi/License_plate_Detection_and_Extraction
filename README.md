An AI powered desktop application to detect vehicle's number plates and extract text. 
The main goal is to create an efficient Automatic Number Plate Identification system. Our model is implemented using Optical Character Recognition on Indian number plates and we achieved an accuracy of 88.3%. The derived output is stored in a text file and can be checked whenever necessary.
